# FFEDS: Framework for Evaluation of Early Detection Systems
FEEDS (Framework for Evaluation of Early Detection Systems) has been developed for the assessment of the generalization capability of a generic Early detection system, which refers to the ability to provide reliable alarms for target events using data different from those used to develop the system. The framework consists of a Python package comprising functions and classes dedicated to the management of geophysical data, simulation in pseudo real-time (i.e., real-time simulation on previously acquired data), and the evaluation of the performance of an alert model. 
The evaluation process of an ED system is complex and involves several phases (Fig. 4). These include: 
(i) data collection and preparation; 
(ii) partitioning of data into training and testing sets; 
(iii) implementation and optimization of the alert model; 
(iv) evaluation of model performance. 
 



# Requirements
FFEDS can be run on any operation system with Python from Release 3.10.9 In addition, you need to have the following packages installed: 

-	pandas, version 1.5.3 or later.
-	numpy, version 1.24.2 or later.
